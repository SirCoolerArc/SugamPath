# PROGRESS.md — SugamPath status at submission

> **Read this file together with `CLAUDE.md`** at the start of every new session. `CLAUDE.md` is the immutable contract; `PROGRESS.md` is the live snapshot. If they ever conflict, `CLAUDE.md` wins, and the conflict gets flagged.

---

## 1. Where we are

- **Stage 0 — complete and tagged.** All 13 items of `CLAUDE.md` §8 shipped. Tag: `stage-0-complete` (commit `64e6945`).
- **Stage 1 — complete.** 4 of 6 items shipped, 2 deliberately skipped with reasoning. (Tag pending; never blocked anything.)
- **Stage 2 — partially shipped, with one item rebuilt under different framing.**
  - **6.1 Hindi support — shipped.** Devanagari PII patterns, simplifier `target_language` parameter (en / hi / code-mixed), cross-language faithfulness judge, ISL chips for Devanagari surface forms via a hand-curated alias map, and a three-position language toggle UI.
  - **6.2 click-to-highlight — skipped by design** (PDF iframe targets cap the achievable visual fidelity; deferred to a future Stage 3).
  - **6.3 per-paragraph confidence dots — skipped** (low user-impact for the demo; the existing faithfulness badge already carries the trust story).
  - **6.4 intent classifier + advice refusal — originally deferred, then rebuilt as voice + text query.** The original spec was deferred because a free-text follow-up *typed* input centres a literate user. A teammate then rebuilt it as a **voice + text query input** at upload time (`/api/query` + `VoiceQueryInput` + `prompts/query.md`), which addresses the audience concern: a deaf user doesn't need to type, a low-literacy adult can ask verbally via the Web Speech API. The prompt is constrained to answer only from the document, refuses advice ("should I take this?", "is this safe?"), and supports the same English / Hindi / code-mixed languages as the simplifier. Spec for the original deferred design preserved at [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-06-intent-classifier-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-06-intent-classifier-design.md) as a record.
- **ISL Play-All — shipped (post-Stage-2 follow-up).** A "play all signs" button next to the audio player walks every ISL chip in the simplified text in document order. While playing, a floating bottom-right player shows the current sign clip; the corresponding word in the simplified text is highlighted with a soft navy tint and a left bar (readable while signing). Backed by a server-side proxy at `/api/isl-video/<fileId>` that streams Drive bytes through our origin, unblocking inline `<video>` playback (which had never worked before — chips used to open Drive in a new tab). This is the headline feature for "actually for a deaf primary user, not just a literate person."
- **Vercel deployment live at [sugam-path.vercel.app](https://sugam-path.vercel.app/).** Auto-deploys from `main`. Fixed one production bug post-deploy: `voiceschanged` race in `AudioPlayer` was leaving the React voices state empty in production builds, so Hindi text was being read by the browser's default English voice. Resolved at click time instead of mount time (`720dab1`).

**Latest commit on submission day:** `67ed1ab` (merge of voice-query branch) on `main`, pushed to `https://github.com/SirCoolerArc/SugamPath`.

## 2. What ships today (concretely)

A user can:

1. Open `http://localhost:3000`, see an editorial landing page with the one-line pitch and three "promise" cards.
2. Drag-drop or click to upload one or more page images / a PDF (cap: 10 MB total). PDFs preview natively in a browser iframe; images render via `next/image`. **Optionally type or speak a specific question about the document** at this stage — the Web Speech API captures voice in English, Hindi, or code-mixed; the `/api/query` endpoint returns a focused answer drawn only from the document, refuses advice, and answers in the question's language.
3. Watch a typewritten *"we do this carefully, on purpose"* loading screen narrate the safety pipeline as it runs (~36 s of narration over a ~40 s pipeline, with a calm "still reading carefully" line if it crosses 50 s).
4. See a side-by-side view: original document on the left, simplified plain-English text on the right, with critical-field spans (turmeric underline) and inline ISL chips for any of 10,243 ISLRTC terms.
5. **Switch the reading form** — a three-position slider above the simplified column flips between *"Plain words, in short paragraphs"*, *"Shorter sentences. Easier to scan."*, and *"Each fact on its own line."* Each position now carries a static label so the affordance is self-documenting. Toggling re-simplifies via `/api/resimplify` (~22 s); previously-seen levels swap instantly from a client cache keyed by `${level}|${language}`.
6. **Switch the output language** — a peer three-position toggle (English / हिन्दी / दोनों) regenerates the simplified text in plain Hindi or Hindi-English code-mixed prose. PII tokens and critical-field placeholders flow through unchanged regardless of language. The faithfulness judge is language-aware so Hindi output isn't false-flagged for paraphrasing durations and quantities.
7. Click any ISL chip to see the sign play **inline** in a small popover. The Drive viewer remains a footer fallback link.
8. **Click "play all signs"** to walk the entire document in ISL: a floating bottom-right player auto-plays each chip's sign in document order; the corresponding word in the simplified text is highlighted with a soft navy tint as the cursor moves; pause / skip-next / stop controls; on completion, Replay / Close. ESC closes. Switching reading-form or language mid-playback closes the player cleanly.
9. Click "READ ALOUD" to hear the simplified text via browser SpeechSynthesis. The voice locale follows the language toggle (`en-IN` for English, `hi-IN` for Hindi or code-mixed) and the player listens for the browser's `voiceschanged` event so the voice list is warm on first click.
10. See action items in a numbered panel below the simplified text, each with `what` / `when` / `verify with` framing — never imperative.
11. See the safety-row badges:
    - **N personal details kept private** (vault size)
    - **M pages read end-to-end** (page count)
    - **Ts careful reading time** (latency)
    - **Faithfulness verdict** — quietly shows ✓ (VERIFIED), a count (VERIFIED_WITH_OMISSIONS, click expands to show the omitted critical fields), or — (UNVERIFIED, click expands to a soft note pointing back to the original). Never a red banner.
    - **Injection finding count** — appears only if the detector flags adversarial content; rust accent, click expands to the verbatim flagged excerpts.
12. **See a calm rust-accent notice** at the top of the result if the document contains text directed at an automated assistant. The notice can be dismissed; the safety badge keeps the signal visible.
13. **See an honest tip below the play-all button** when the language is not English: *"ISL signs are English-grounded — the play-all flow covers more of the document when the text is in English."* Surfaces a known coverage trade-off rather than hiding it.
14. **See status-aware error copy** if anything fails — distinct text for 400 / 413 / 422-extraction / 422-simplification / 502-busy / 502-RECITATION / network failure. "Try again with the same document" only appears for transient errors; 4xx errors offer "upload a different document". The original Files persist on the error stage so retry doesn't force re-upload.

PII is tokenised before any LLM call beyond the initial vision pass; reconstructed only on the response object returned to the client; never persisted. The serialised vault round-trips between `/api/process` and `/api/resimplify` — same PII surface as the rendered fields, no new exposure.

| Simplifier | Cross-field invariant 1:1 actions; placeholders all resolve | ✅ commits `2430b8f`, `2022688` | `npx tsx scripts/test_simplifier.ts --cached` |
| ISL dictionary | 10,243 unique terms synced; key-less JSON | ✅ commit `1f8cbb7` | `curl /api/isl-dictionary` |

### Stage 1

| # | Item | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14 | Faithfulness judge + three-state badge | ✅ commit `52713ff` | 3/3 synthetic tests pass; live route VERIFIED_WITH_OMISSIONS on real discharge; judge sees redacted only |
| 15 | Injection-check detector + dismissible notice | ✅ commit `8c259fb` | 4/4 synthetic tests pass; parallel with simplifier; ~1.3 s detector latency |
| 16 | Reading-form slider (paragraphs / shorter / list) | ✅ commit `e098b65`, polish in `11c094e` | `/api/resimplify` HTTP 200 on both `shorter` (22 s) and `list` (23 s); client cache verified |
| 17 | Status-aware error copy + retry-same-doc + longer narrative | ✅ commit `cf660d0` | 400/413 server-side smoke tests pass |
| 18 | Two demo presets with cached responses | ⏭️ skipped | No longer needed once Gemini moved to paid tier |
| 19 | SafetyBadges expand-on-click for the vault count | ⏭️ skipped | Cosmetic; the existing copy already says "N personal details kept private" |

### Stage 2

| # | Item | Status | Commits |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1.1 | Devanagari PII regex cues | ✅ | `9dfbc60` |
| 6.1.2 | `target_language` parameter on simplifier | ✅ | `5909e5b` |

| 6.1.4 | Hindi ISL aliases + language toggle UI + UX polish | ✅ | `935cc17`, `11c094e` |
| 6.2 | Click-to-highlight | ⏭️ skipped (PDF iframe limit) | — |
| 6.3 | Per-paragraph confidence dots | ⏭️ skipped (low impact) | — |
| 6.4 | Voice + text query at upload (rebuilt from the deferred intent classifier) | ✅ | `a44a6e1`, `7cd7740`, `2ad06d9`, `578f0f1`, merged via `67ed1ab` |

### ISL Play-All (post-Stage-2 follow-up)

| Layer | Status | Commits |
|---|---|---|
| Types (`videoFallbackUrl`, `ISLSequenceItem`) | ✅ | `e1999ba` |
| Chip-resolver extraction (`lib/chip_resolver.ts`, regression test) | ✅ | `a513d93` |
| Sequencer (`lib/isl_sequencer.ts`, 8 test cases + 1 regression) | ✅ | `e470a7e`, `d444877` (fix) |
| Drive-streaming proxy (`/api/isl-video/[fileId]`) | ✅ | `a6c1e11` |
| Dictionary URL rewrite to proxy + fallback link | ✅ | `e0b2ab8` |
| Inline `<video>` in chip popover | ✅ | `bf5bfbf` |
| Dictionary fetch hoisted to SideBySideViewer | ✅ | `e4da704` |
| `activeChip` highlight + auto-scroll in SimplifiedText | ✅ | `9fc057b`, `2b8c6c7` (fix) |
| Play-all button + floating player | ✅ | `6ef3f3c`, `eac035c`, `2a5a716` (fix) |
| Readable highlight + Hindi-coverage notice | ✅ | `6f51c5c` |

Three real bugs were caught and fixed during execution: a renderer/sequencer divergence on critical-field HTML (`d444877`), a sequence-shrinkage race on simplification regenerate (`2a5a716`), and an extractor sentinel-split drop that produced undefined fields under the Devanagari patterns (`2b8c6c7`).

## 5. Known sharp edges (acceptable for v1)

- **Over-redacted "10:28 a.m."** — vision LLM tags admission times as DATE in `pii_spans`. Vault tokenises correctly. Cosmetic over-redaction; safer direction.
- **`SDO MOTIHARI SADAR` flagged as NAME** — OBC certificate's signing role tagged as a name because of the "Digitally signed by …" cue. Same false-positive class; safer direction.
- **Hindi ISL coverage is limited** — the alias map has ~30 hand-curated Hindi → English entries. A play-all run on a Hindi document produces a sparser sequence than English. Surfaced honestly via the inline tip below the play-all button. Future work: expand the alias map to ~100 entries OR (heavier) Gemini-driven sequence enrichment for Hindi mode.
- **PDF original column is an iframe**, so click-to-highlight (Stage 2 6.2) is bounded to "scroll to the page" rather than visual span-level highlight. Image documents have full DOM access and could support sub-paragraph highlight in a future Stage 3.
- **Faithfulness omissions on the discharge** — a typical real-document run returns VERIFIED_WITH_OMISSIONS with 4-7 omitted fields, mostly UHIDs and dates the simplifier reasonably skipped (header bookkeeping).
- **Resimplify latency** — ~22 s per slider toggle on first visit. Cache hit is instant.
